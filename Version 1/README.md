# DES-OPF-Design
This repository includes an MILP model to design a Distributed Energy System, which can be combined with NLP formulations for balanced AC optimal power flow (OPF) to form an MINLP model overall. \
Please use _t9_main.py_ to run MILP, NLP and/or MINLP models. 

Note that the results from the OPF class (voltage magnitudes, angles, active/reactive powers, and currents)
are all returned in p.u. Please use the bases of these to convert them to SI units.
